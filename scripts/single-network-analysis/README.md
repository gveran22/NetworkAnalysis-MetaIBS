## üìù File Details

- `filtering.R`: Applies filtering steps to a phyloseq object and saves the output to `outputs/single-network-analysis/filtered_otus/`.
- `fit_network.R`: Runs the SpiecEasi pipeline using three methods (`glasso`, `mb`, `slr`). Outputs are saved in `outputs/single-network-analysis/spiec-easi-results/`. Parameters for SpiecEasi can be modified in this script.
- `process.R`: Executes the full pipeline, including filtering and network inference. Filtering parameters are loaded from `tools/analysis_configs`.
- `venn-diagramm.R`: Generates Venn diagrams to compare edge overlaps across the different network inference methods. This script is standalone and should be run **after the inference is complete**, using the association matrices as input.
