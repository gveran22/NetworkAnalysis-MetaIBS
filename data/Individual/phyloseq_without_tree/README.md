# Phyloseq objects without phylogenetic trees

This directory contains all the phyloseq objects saved as `.rds` files, obtained from preprocessing the raw data for each dataset (refer to the [scripts/analysis-individual/](../../../scripts/analysis-individual/) folder for more information on how the data was preprocessed).

Phyloseq objects in this directory contain:
- an ASV table (`otu_table()`);
- a taxonomic table (`tax_table()`);
- a metadata table (`sample_data()`).

These phyloseq objects without a phylogenetic tree are the same ones used as input for inferring a phylogenetic tree (in the [phylotree/](../../analysis-individual/CLUSTER/phylotree/) directory). They are also useful for analyses on combined datasets, as you can't merge phylogenetic trees...
